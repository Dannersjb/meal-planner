# CS50 Final Project - Meal Planner

## Technologies

- React Native (expo)
- TypeScript
- SQLite

I wanted to build on my existing React knowledge and have a go at using React Native, which is a technology built with JavaScript for developing Mobile Applications and can work with both Android and IOs devices.

React Native uses components similar to React but instead of being synactical sugar to represent HTML in JSX, it represents native mobile components because mobile applications don't render HTML and CSS like web browsers but React Native provides these Native tags and stylesheets that are familiar to web developers.

I also took this project as a good opportunity to practive some graphic design skills, so I've premade designs of what I'd like the app to look like first and tries to create my own SVGs for icons using figma and Inkscape.

## Use case

The application is a meal planning app, where a user can create their own custom recipes and add them to a meal calendar. There is also a shopping list to keep track of what food needs to be bought for each week.

## SQLite Database Design

See [`db/schema.sql`](db/schema.sql) for the schema or [`db/design.md`](db/design.md) for a visual/table summary.
